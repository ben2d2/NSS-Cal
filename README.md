Goals
• Allow users to input month and year arguments from command line via cal.rb in NSS-Cal/
• Display a month from any given year between 1800-3000
• Display any given full year between 1800-3000

Features
• Contains simple methods for calculating proper spacing, start day of a month, & all data to complete a calendar

Limitations
• Functionality is limited to years between 1800-3000
• Only takes two arguments in number format (e.g. 2 2012 => February 2012)

How to Use It
• User runs cal.rb file and inputs a specific year and/or month

Dependancies
• Requires lib/cal.rb for methods
• Ruby v-1.8.7
